This is Trac-Care. It is a mental health and wellness tracker/journaling service. Upon opening the site,
you will be prompted to a register page where you need to enter your first name, a username, a password, and that same password to use as confirmation to create an account. After following all of those steps, you will be asked to log back in. Once you log in,
you are directed to a homepage that greets you.

There are several pages you can begin to explore. First is the journal page. This page allows you to submit journal entries. You can type as much or as little as you want. However, you need to type something: you cannot submit a blank entry. Once you submit, you will be directed to the entries page, which displays all of the journal entries you've ever made and the date you submitted them. The entries page can also be accessed by itself if you click on the journal drop down bar and click on entries.

You can also start tracking habits. Some habits that you can track include the amount of sleep you got, the amount of exercise you performed, and the amount of screentime you've had. To access these places to log this data, tap on the habits drop down bar, and you can view tabs for sleep, exercise, and screen time.

The sleep tab allows you to enter the amount of sleep you got to the nearest hour. You won't be able to enter a fraction or a value below 0/above 24. Once you submit, you will be redirected to the habits page where you can view your entry. You can also see the average of all of your entries, and you will be given a recommendation based on that average.

Exercise and screen time work similarly except they record both hours and minutes. You still can't enter a fraction or values below 0/above 24 for the hours or values below 0/above 59 for minutes. You also can't leave either section blank. If you wish to only record 8 hours, for instance, you need to toggle to 8 for hours and 0 for minutes. Once you submit, you will again be redirected to the habits page where you can view your exercise and screen time entries in their respective tables, the average of those entries, and the recommendations based on those averages.

There is also an affirmations page. This page just populates itself with an affirmation/quote upon refreshing. Refresh a few times to see!

Finally, you have the ability to change your password if you wish. If you go to the 'Change Password' page on the navigation bar, you will be redirected to a page where you will be prompted to enter a password and that same password as confirmation. Once you do that, you will be redirected to the homepage. However, once you log out, you have to log back in using that new password.
